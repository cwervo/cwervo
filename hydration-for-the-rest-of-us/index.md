# Hydration for the rest of us

I was browsing the Walgreens by Union Square (TODO: link/add pic on Google Maps) and I wanted some hydration supplements. I've been using Liquid IV and LMNT for a few years now and got [obsessed with hydration science a bit when I got COVID](link to Twitter for hydration or something). When I noticed a few years ago Liquid IV had a bunch of sugar I switched to LMNT, though I now use both (because they have differences).

Anyway, back to my Walgreens trip:

I got the section of the store and noticed it's expanded rapidly since the last time I can into a convenience store (CVS, Walgreens, Duane Reed)! In this post I want to talk about what's on these shelves, what's good, what's bad, &amp; what's interesting.

## TODO:
- [ ] Big shelf overview (outline sections & number/label them in Figma)
- [ ] The good (market analysis 2024)
- [ ] The bad (the expense / the sugar â€” well, it's not all bad (link to research on sugar and hydration in extreme situations like athletes experiencing heat stroke or people who are going through mortally dangerous dehydration))
- [ ] The interesting (new player, upper market, higher class hydration at Walgreens, still not as expensive as LMNT (double check?)

- [ ] Conclusion: It's interesting to see as we near the end of 2024 that hydration had gone from a boutique experience or niche athlete/nerd thing to something that's in mid market (CostCo) and low market (CVS, Walgreens) stores.
