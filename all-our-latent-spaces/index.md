[Latent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space#:~:text=A%20latent%20space%2C%20also%20known,another%20in%20the%20latent%20space.) are n-tuple spaces
with points & vectors & relations (these relations are called [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor)).

[Carl Sagan's Bunyan Lecture 1993](https://youtu.be/Hez5MyKQIMs) walks through a kind of [Eames _Powers of Ten_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)
for perspectives using satelite imagery (cameras), [radiochromatography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/radiochromatography) (the detection
chemicals in a solution using their bounce-back signal when you hit them with radio waves, a kind of small "radio camera"), & [infrared photos of the earth](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo3/l5_p5.html)
("heat cameras").

So there's this idea of cameras at different [electromagnetic scales](https://www.google.com/search?q=electromagnetic+spectrum&oq=electromagnetic+&aqs=chrome.0.0i20i263i433i512l2j69i57j0i433i512l2j0i131i433i512j0i433i512j0i131i433i512j0i433i512l2.4769j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) & this idea of
latent spaces. Recently latent spaces have been all the range, doing everything from [solving Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) (a search space problem with more atoms than there are in the universe) to [folding proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2).

There's a latent space, albiet it's only 3-dimensional, of cameras organized by EM scale & it forms a kind of `interplanetary vision`.

Likewise, there's a latent space of knowledge. I think it looks a bit like a tree with two branches & then the merge.

- all knowledge
    - science
        - math
            - physics
                - chemistry
                    - biology
    - humanities

But you could easily imagine a line from `biology` to `humanities` through various human-focused sciences. A non-exhaustive list:
- meterology (the study of weather & our effects on it)
- psychopharmacology (the study of how compounds affect our sympathetic & parasympathetic nervous systems & eventually our moods & our bodies)
- biokinematics (the study of how compounds move through the body)
- [pharmacokinematics](https://genomind.com/providers/introduction-to-pharmacokinetics-four-steps-in-a-drugs-journey-through-the-body/)
- anestheology (the medical study of consciousness)
