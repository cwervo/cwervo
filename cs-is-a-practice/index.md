In [Vocational Guidance and its Strategies](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1245230.pdf):

> A person’s performance for a vocation is influenced by the aspirations and choice of their
parents. This may result in an unsatisfactory placement of the student. However, it is important
to note that the vocational choice should be decided more on the individual’s ability, interest,
aptitude, rather than on parental aspirations alone. Some individuals are often found to be
dissatisfied in the work they are doing and are not properly adjusted, to the work environment
leading to frustration, state of stress, diminished productivity, etc. An Unfavourable attitude
of any individual is not conducive for the work culture in any organization. Efforts must
consciously be made by educational institutions to work towards developing a positive attitude
towards work in their students. If this can be done in the institution, it can be expected that
there would be a transfer of this in the work situation. The success or failure of a person
in a vocation depends upon, many others factors including satisfaction one derives from
the vocation. satisfaction results from working in harmony with one’s own potentialities,
strengths, weaknesses, etc. A well organized system of vocational information readily
available to students and set up which encourages students and trains them to find out the
available information about careers, from the basis for the choice of vocational e strategies

There is a body of work around vocational guidance. Huh.
